Happyness:

Today I learned about object literals. for example:

var car = {
  make: 'Jeep',
  model: 'Wrangler',
  year: 1992
}
The object is the car and the properties are the make, model and year. We could have
a whole list of objects such as the engine type, the kind of gas it uses, the color etc.
We learned about DOM = Document Object Model. it is a representation of HTML.

An object can also incorporate an Array for example:

var arr [toyota, jeep, buick]
  var toyota {
    make: 'comry'
    year: 2011
  }
  var jeep {
    make: 'wrangler'
    year: 1992
  }
  var buick {
    make: 'station wagon'
    year: 1967
  }

  Sadness:
  I am having problems with git hub.
