Happyness:
Today we learned about object constructors. It makes complete sense when we see it in class and
then it is hard to wrap my head around it when I am alone.
I am slow at this stuff but I am not going to give up.
When I think about it, today was the 13th day, in my life, that I have spent in a classroom learning
how to code so I feel like I am doing pretty good, considering.

Sadness:
I don't like that Brian will tell us we can work on practicing writing code if we feel that will help
in the long run but then you turn in what you did and you don't get full points for that. It confuses me.
so now I only get half the points and I am a day behind.
