Happyness:
Today we learned about building forms and tables. I completed constructure functions on my salmon cookies project today. Very difficult stuff but rewarding when it printed to my console.
I am only one day behind and feeling pretty good about this!

Sadness:
I felt really bad about my progress thus far in 201. But after talking to most of the class, I understand the content as well as anyone else. Except for the students who have had coding experience but then again, I wouldn't expect to understand it like that. we are on day 8!
