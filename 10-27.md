Happyness:
Today we worked in pairs (in my case there were three of us) building a recipe and shopping list for chocolate pizza. I was impressed by how our team got the project complete by 5pm. It looked great.

Sadness:
I want to be great at coding. When I get home and I am working by myself it's like a alien in the with the a nose that vacuums comes into my head and sucks out all the info I have learned so far. So I read and read and read, but it seems all of the examples are for simple tasks that I can do. I'm pretty much freaking out!
