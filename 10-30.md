Happyness:
Today I decided to wait to take 301 seeing that I do not understand the fundamentals of code. It is a relief because I really want to be a developer. It is a career switch that I decided to make and if I don't succeed at this, I don't know what to do.

Sadness:
I will miss going through this journey with my classmates. It is an incredible group of people!
